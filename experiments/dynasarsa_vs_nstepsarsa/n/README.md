# Varying N
## A simple experiment varying method parameters

Can obtain better sample efficiency with our methods by simply changing our method parameters? Using our most sample efficienty epsilon decay multipliers, we vary n in nstepsarsa and planning steps (called n for simplicity) in dynasarsa.
